# The Dog-Earred Bookmark Server #

## Overview ##

The Dog-Earred Bookmark Server (DEBS) is a simple stand-alone bookmark server that stores and organizes bookmarks. The first version, the proof of concept, will be a simple cgi script with no real security (e.g. seperate user accounts, etc).

The goal is to have a bookmark server that can be run from the cheapest barebones shared webserver with a smattering of different datasources.

Specifications:
*  Probably written in python
*  Support for MySQL, SQLite, and flat-file is desired
*  First version will support a simple GET/POST access scheme (no fancy REST)
